# Annoto Manual for users

Open the web app and you will see an image. Below the image there are buttons with labels that can be used to annotate the image. 

Click on one of the annotation buttons to create an annotation for the displayed image. The annotation is then stored into the `.annoto`-folder in the home directory of your local file system.

As long as you are not in a production environment, you can view the contents of this `.annoto` folder using the API-route `/debug/data`.
