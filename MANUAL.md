# Annoto Manual for users

Open the web app and you will see a dialogue window, asking you to confirm that you are attentive and in the proper condition to annotate images.

After confirming, you will see an image. Below the image there are buttons with labels that can be used to annotate the image. Without confirming, it is not possible to proceed annotating the images.

Click on one of the annotation buttons to create an annotation for the displayed image. The annotation is then stored into the `~/.annoto`-folder in your local file system.
